# Lil Invention Fo Da Tuk-Tuk Drivers


## Basic Details
### Team name:- Power Surge 


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abdel Baasit - College of engineering perumon
- Member 2: Sian Soj - College of engineering perumon
- Member 3: Karthik Murali - College of engineering perumon

### Project Description
This skibidi device made for the world's more enthusiastic drivers, particularly tuk-tuk drivers and those notorious "chapri" drivers who believe that signaling is merely a suggestion. This gadget is similar to a backseat driver, but instead of urging you to slow down, it serves as a reminder that it is OK to indicate when it is your turn.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Preventing tuk tuk drivers from "driving on point"

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
